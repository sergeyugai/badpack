# BadPack

BadPack is an opinionated admin panel for Laravel.
It allows you to build powerful admin panels **very fast**.

It uses [Backpack for Laravel](https://backpackforlaravel.com) as its base and is fully compatible with it; however, it 
provides a very different interface to the same operations. This means that, while this project is free to use, you 
do need to review **Backpack License** before going to production.

This package is basically just a wrapper around Backpack's API to make it more usable, but, as mentioned earlier, its
opinionated. Then again, its fully compatible, thus you don't really have to worry and if you don't like certain features,
you don't need to use them.
